# TicTacToe Game / Mini-Max Algorithm

 Have developed the Tictactoe game in Unity with C# language. I developed this game to practice the minimax algorithm to create AI logic. 
This game is the basic tictactoe game. 2 users can play together on the same screen or user can play against AI. For now Minimax algorithm always wins the game.

Here are some visual records from the game:
